                    Capo on 3rd
                    [Verse]
                    A            A6         D/A
                    When sadness fills your heart
                        F#m                            Eadd9        E9
                    And sorrow hides the longing to be free
                    A              A6         D/A
                    When things go wrong each day
                    F#m                              Eadd9        E9
                    You fix your mind to 'scape your misery

                    [Chorus]
                    F#m
                    Your troubled young life
                        A        A6
                    Had made you turn
                         D/A            Eadd9        E9
                    To a needle of death

                    How strange, your happy words
                    Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
                    How tears have filled the eyes
                    Of friends that you once had walked among

                    [Chorus]

                    One grain of pure white snow
                    Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
                    In peace your mind withdraws
                    Your death's so near your soul can't feel no pain

                    [Chorus]

                    Your mother stands a'cryin'
                    While to the earth your body's slowly cast
                    Your father stands in silence
                    Caressing every young dream of the past

                    [Chorus]

                    Through ages, man's desires
                    To free his mind, to release his very soul
                    Has proved to all who live
                    That death itself is freedom for evermore

                    [Chorus]
