      I have no time
      I have no time to spend with you
      You talk of nothing, what can you do
      You live like kings and you know it's true
      That if famine crossed the waters that'll be the end of you
      I've heard of people who till the earth
      Who saw their seeds for all they're worth
      Who cry for rain all summer long
      And weep for the day when winter's passed and gone
      If cherry trees bore fruit of gold
      The birds would die, their wings would fold
      They'd sing no more their song of love
      Nor await the morning sun that lights the sky above
      If war returns like it did before
      A kiddy's penny would be no more
      They'd cry for love and their candy too
      But a kiddy's wants are nothing 'till killin' days are thru'
      So drink your fill be happy now
      The times will change and you'll wonder how
      A man could die from lack of food
      But you don't give a damn, no reason why you should

      [Verse]
      A            A6         D/A
      When sadness fills your heart
          F#m                            Eadd9        E9
      And sorrow hides the longing to be free
      A              A6         D/A
      When things go wrong each day
      F#m                              Eadd9        E9
      You fix your mind to 'scape your misery
       
      [Chorus]
      F#m
      Your troubled young life
          A        A6
      Had made you turn
           D/A            Eadd9        E9
      To a needle of death
       
      How strange, your happy words
      Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
      How tears have filled the eyes
      Of friends that you once had walked among
       
      [Chorus]
      
      One grain of pure white snow
      Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
      In peace your mind withdraws
      Your death's so near your soul can't feel no pain
       
      [Chorus]
      
      Your mother stands a'cryin'
      While to the earth your body's slowly cast
      Your father stands in silence
      Caressing every young dream of the past
       
      [Chorus]
       
      Through ages, man's desires
      To free his mind, to release his very soul
      Has proved to all who live
      That death itself is freedom for evermore
      
      [Chorus]
       
      End on A

           Dm
      Come walk the streets of crime
          Am                Dm
      And colour bright the corners
         C9            Dm
      Of love with the earth

              Dm
      See the dazzling nightlife grow
      Am                  Dm
      Beyond the dawn and burning
         C9            Dm
      In the heart of Soho

      Dm
      Hear the market cries
                    G9    Dm
      And see their wares displayed
                  ?      Em      Dm
      Through the window of your soul
      
      Come watch the naked dance
      That spins before your very eyes
      Naked like the sun

      Step inside where men before
      Have drunk to fill to senseless
      Till the dreams fade and die

      And free and easy
      Does the blood red wine come flowing
      From the glass to your veins

      And the midday dream is silent
      Thou gardens where you're resting
      From the troubles of your mind
      
      And though the sun is burning brightly
      All within the gardens
      Are the sleeping oris dead

      And through the afternoon
      The buzzing bees do harmonise
      Through the rushing sale daylig

                              A            A7
      They call me on and on across the universe

Eleanor Rigby


[Intro]
C                          Em
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

[Verse 1]
Em
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice in the church
                    C                Em
where a wedding has been, lives in a dream.
Waits at the window, wearing the face
                               C               Em
that she keeps in a jar by the door, who is it for?

[Chorus]
Em7        	Em6
All the lonely people
C                  	Em
Where do they all come from?
Em7        	Em6
All the lonely people
C               	Em
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie, writing the words
of a sermon that no one will hear, no-one comes near.
Look at him working, darning his socks
in the night when there’s nobody there, what does he care?

[Chorus]

[Intro]

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
and was buried along with her name, nobody came.
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
from his hands as he walks from the grave, no-one was saved.

Penny Lane chords
Capo II

[Verse 1]
        A               F#m            Bm          E7
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
        A                 F#m              Am
of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to have known
                                F           E7
And all the people that come and go stop and say hello


[Verse 2]
      A           F#m           Bm       E7
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
          A                 F#m            Am
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
                            F          E7            D
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, very strange.


[Chorus]
     G             Bm             C
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back


[Verse 3]
        A               F#m             Bm         E7         A
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass and in his pocket is a
F#m             Am
portrait of the queen.
                                F             E7
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.


[Interlude] (piccolo trumpet)

A  F#m  D6  E  A  F#m  Am7

F#m7  Fmaj7  Esus4  E    D

[Chorus 2]
     G             Bm             C
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                      Bm     C              E7
   A four of fish and finger pies in summer meanwhile back


[Verse 4]
          A              F#m           Bm        E7
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
          A                F#m            Am
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
                                     F
And though she feels as if she's in a play
      E7
She is anyway.


[Verse 5]
        A               F#m            Bm       E7
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer.
          A               F#m           Am
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
                           F           E7
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,
D
very strange.


[Chorus]
     G             Bm             C
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back


[Outro]
A                   C#m             D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A                 C#m            D
There beneath the blue suburban skies.
     A
Penny Lane

Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long
Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long
The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone


[Chorus]

[Verse]
        Am
With the horses that you ride,
           D           F
And the feelings left inside,
         Am               F        G        Am
Comes a time you need to leave all that behind,
Am
Well they claim they'd like to know,
          D                 F
and they wont could let you go
          Am          F          G      D
And the people gotta run for the last show

[Chorus]
                      F
Well there is all we want
                        Am
To live and die by the sword,
                         G
Well they tried to complicate you
                      D
But you left it all behind
                    F
All the worldly possessions
                  Am
Are left for recollections
                 G     E7   Am
And finally it's all gone

[Verse]
Am
They're releasing all the hounds,
        D                 F
What is lost can still be found,
           Am                 F                G      Am
When you're walking with your fear down on the ground
Am
Well there's those who choose to run
        D               F
Following the setting sun,
        Am              F      G      D
And now it seems the journey's has begun

[Chorus]
                      F
Well there is all we want
                        Am
To live and die by the sword,
                         G
Well they tried to complicate you
                      D
But you left it all behind

All the worldly possessions

And finally it's all gone

there's a time you need to leave it all behind

[Chorus]

Well there is all we want

Cause you're promised to a wealthy man

Take a look, what are you seeing?
   G                         D
Is that a noose or a wedding band
D                    Am
Should I go to see a healer

Nervous twitchin' in my head

Uh...

Better days are far behind me

To take the ghost and lock it up inside

And maybe i am down but I'm not beaten

Like anything we were born to die

Em                               G
Look at your young men fighting, look at your women crying
Em                            G                      D/F#
Look at your young men dying, the way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding, look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading, the way we've always done before (A)

              Em       G                   D/F#
My hands are tied! The billions shift from side to side
         Em
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
         G                  D/F#
For the love of God and our human rights
    Em
And all these things are swept aside
   G                 D/F#
By bloody hands time can't deny
        Em
And are washed away by your genocide
    G                 D/F#                 A  B/A  C/A  D/A
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

Did you wear a black armband when they shot the man who said
 Em
"Peace could last forever"
          G                   Bm
And in my first memories they shot Kennedy
Em                 C          D        G              Bm
I went numb when I learned to see so I never fell for Vietnam
           Em                                     G
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all that you can't trust freedom
          Bm                     Em
When it's not in your hands when everybody's fightin' for the

And I don't need your civil war
G            Bm                       Em  C D
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
G            Bm                          Em
You're power hungry sellin' soldiers In a human grocery store ain't that fresh

Look at the world we're killing, the way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed, look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed, and I don't want to hear no more (A)

             Em        G                  D/F#
My hands are tied! For all I've seen has changed my mind!
              Em
But still the wars go on and the years go by
         G             D/F#
With no love of God or human rights

'cause all these dreams are swept aside

Once had a friend
They found him in a car
A hose to the window
And the motor running hot
Seems he couldn't take it
The rhetoric of life
Someone found him naked
With a note right by his side
A note right by his side


He can't take it back
Neither can I
No, neither can I


Mommy and daddy
I've borrowed the car
to sleep on the floor
I'm sorry so much
For bringing my own living hell to
your door
Thanks for all the flowers
At the ringside seat
Thanks for nothing everyone
The prayers were too weak




This is the way
It happens all the time
Can you pay attention
To everyone that cries
Remember you can make it through
And make it new
Only if you try
You gotta try


Cause you can't take it back
Neither can I
No, neither can I


Mommy and daddy
I've borrowed the car
to sleep on the floor
I'm sorry so much
For bringing my own living hell to your door
But things had gotten heavy
Everything was deep
Nothing really mattered
So I just went to sleep
I just went to sleep
And I can't take it back
I won't try


I won't try
I won't try
I won't try
I won't try


Mommy and daddy
I've borrowed the car
to sleep on the floor
Mommy and daddy
I'm sorry to tell you, life is a bore
Don't send any flowers
Don't send anymore
Cause I can't give it back
No more...

D                 C         G
When you look you see right through me
D                C      G
Cut the rope, I fell to my knees
D              C      G
Fallen, broken every single time

D              C      G
Always keep me under finger
D                     C         G
That's the spot where you would do me
      D                C        G     D
Might see some type of pleasure in my mind

[Chorus]
D                    C
Yeah, here comes the water
            G                             D
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
              D
This time you see

[Verse]
D                C       G
When you seek me you destroy me
D                C         G
Rape my mind and smell the poppies
D                C            G
Born in blood in every single time

D              C     G
Always keep me under finger
D                     C         D
That's the spot where you might linger
      D                C        G     D
Might see some type of pleasure in my mind

[Chorus]
D                    C
Yeah, here comes the water
            G                             D
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
              D
This time you see
          C
Like holy water
        G                                 D
It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
               D
This time with me

(Here I go to D, F, G, and back to D power chords, before going back to the regular chords)

[Verse]
D                 C         G
When you look you see right through me
D             C       G
Cut the rope, fell to my knees
D              C     G
Born and bloodied, every single time

Wild Rover
[Intro]
G G G G

[Verse 1]
     G                            C
I've been a wild rover for many a year
  G            C        D7          G
I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
    G                                    C
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
      G          C             D7       G
And I never will play the wild rover no more


[Chorus]
         D7           G                C
And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
       G             C         D7        G
Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more


[Verse 2]
I went in to an alehouse I used to frequent  		G C
And I told the landlady me money was spent     	G C D7 G
I asked her for credit, she answered me "Nay!"  	G C
"Such custom as yours I could have any day!" 		G C D7 G

[Verse 3]
I took out of me pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said: "I have whiskeys and wines on the best!
And the words that I told you were only in jest!"

[Verse 4]
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they've caressed me as oftimes before
I never will play the wild rover no more.

Dm                 C     Dm
While In the merry month of may from me home I started
Dm       C        Dm   C 
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed my darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother
     Dm              C     Dm                    C
Then off to reap the corn, and leave where I was born
Dm                C   
Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues for rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

[Chorus]
Am        C           Dm
One, two, three four, five
Dm
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
C                      Am        C     Dm
All the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early
Took a drop of the pure to keep me heart from sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking
They hear the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required
'till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it's such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city
Then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, in a neat locality
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

From there I got away, me spirits never falling
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead
Or better far instead on the rocky road to Dublin

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing
"Hurrah me soul" says I, me Shillelagh I’ll apply
Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in
With a load "hurray !" joined in the affray
We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin

  G                             C           G
On the Fourth of July, eighteen hundred and six
                                   D
We set sail from the sweet cove of Cork
        G                   C        G
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
                   D           G
For the Grand City Hall in New York

'Twas a wonderful craft
        D
She was rigged fore and aft
    G                D
And oh, how the wild wind drove her
          G
She stood several blasts
        C            G
She had twenty seven masts
                              D   G
And they called her The Irish Rover

There was awl Mickey Coote who played hard on his flute
When the ladies lined up for a set
He was tootin' with skill for each sparkling quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his smart witty talk, he was cock of the walk
And he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew at a glance when he took up his stance
That he sailed in The Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And Fighting Bill Treacy from Dover
And your man, Mick MacCann from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover

For a sailor it's always a bother of life
So lonesome by night and by day
That he longs for the shore
And a charming young whore
Who will melt all his troubles away
All the noise and the rout
Filled with poitin and stout
For him soon it's done and over
Of the love of a maid he is never afraid
An old salt from the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
And that whale of a crew was reduced down to two
Just myself and the Captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock, oh Lord, what a shock
The boat it was turned right over
Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
I'm the last of The Irish Rover

What will we do with the drunken sailor?
Early in the morning!

[chorus]
Way, hey and up she rises,
Early, in the morning!
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Early in the morning!
Put him in a long boat till his sober,
Early in the morning!
Stick him in the scuppers with a hosepipe on him,
Early in the morning!
Put him in the bed with the captain's daughter,
Early in the morning!
That's what we do with a drunken sailor,
Early in the morning!

Whiskey in the Jar
Capo 2nd fret
[Verse]
   C                    Am
As I was going over the far fam'd Kerry Mountains,
  F                                C            G
I met with Captain Farrel, and his money he was countin',
  C                               Am
I first produced my pistol, and I than produced my rapier,
         F                         C
Sayin': "Stand and deliver for you are a bold deceiver". 
[Chorus]
      G
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da,
C
Whack for the daddy ol',
F
Whack for the daddy ol',
        C       G      C
There's whiskey in the jar. 
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,         C   Am
I put it in my pocket, and I took it home to Jenny,         F   C  G
She sighed, and she swore that she never would deceive me,  C   Am
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy.    F   C  G
I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber,
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder,
But Jenny drew my charges and she filled them out with water,
Then sent for Captain Farrel, to be ready for the slaughter.
'Twas early in the morning just before I rose to travel,
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise, Captain Farrel,
I first produced my pistol for she stole away my rapier,
But I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.
Now there's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
If anyone can aid me 'tis my brother in the army,
If I can find his station, in Cork or in Killarney,
And if he'll go with me we'll go roving in Kilkenny,
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my old a-sporting Jenny.

Looking out for love

In the night so still
        Am          G
Oh I'll build you a kingdom
        F            E7
In that house on the hill

Looking out for love
Big, big love

You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill

Lyrics:

[VERSE 1]

She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been

[CHORUS]

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

[VERSE 2]

You don't know what it means to win
Come down and see me again

[CHORUS]

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

 J'ai perdu mon cartable , j'ai perdu mes parents

[Chorus]




[Intro] 
[Verse 1] Cm   Eb   Fm   Ab  Bb
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

[Bridge A]
     Ab                 Gm
She comes and goes and comes and goes
     Gb
Like no one can

[Verse 2]
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

[Bridge A+B]
      Ab                 Gm
She comes and goes and comes and goes
     Gb
Like no one can
     Ab                 Gm
She comes and goes and no one knows
      Fm        Gm          Ab
She's slipping through my hands



[Chorus]
She's always buzzing just like
Fm     Bb    Cm
Neon, neon
Fm     Bb    Cm
Neon, neon
Fm      Bb     Cm         Bb        Ab
Who knows how long, how long, how long
         Fm
She can go before she burns [intro] away

[Verse 3]
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can

[Bridge A+B] [Chorus]

Don’t rain on my firewood (Paul Gilbert)




Vibrato (Paul Gilbert)


I didn't know it was night time til I saw the moon
Didn't know it was summer 2 weeks into june
Didn't know you were standing right on top my door
I was visiting just listing to my vibrato

I've been using vibrato since I was a kid
I didn't use it this time imagine if I did
It can lift a big wave and it's so powerful
Everybody just listen to my vibrato

I've been using vibrato since I was a kid
I didn't use it this time imagine if I did
It can lift a big wave and it's so powerful
Everybody just listen to my vibrato

It's a natural feeling when I make a sound
Take a regular note and mold it all around
You can shake it up fast or take it nice and slow
Keep it busy just listening to my vibrato x3
Everybody just listening to my vibrato
Being 15 again

[Verse]
               Am
It starts with one thing I don't know why
   G
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
F
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
   G
To explain in due time

All I know, time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to 

Watch you go, I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

[Chorus]
           Am              C
I tried so hard and got so far
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter
         Am              C
I had to fall to lose it all
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter





[Verse]
Am
One thing, I don't know why
   G
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
F
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
   G
To remind myself how

I tried so hard, in spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then 
but it all comes back to me 

In the end you kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

[Chorus] Am C G F x2 Am C G F x2

[Bridge] Am G F G x2
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this 
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Verse 1] F#m D A E (x2) D E
  F#m                        D
I’m tired of being what you want me to be
 A
Feeling so faithless
     E
Lost under the surface
  F#m                           D
I don’t know what you’re expecting of me
    A
Put under the pressure
   E                 D
of walking in your shoes
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)


[Pre-Chorus]
       F#m
Every step that I take is
  A                 D
another mistake to you
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)


[Chorus] F#m D A E (x2) F#
F#m             D
I’ve become so numb
                   A
I can’t feel you there
            E
Become so tired
              F#m
So much more aware
               D
I’m becoming this
               A
All I want to do
                 E
Is be more like me
                  F#m
And be less like you






[Verse 2] 
                          D
Can’t you see that you’re smothering me
 A                     E                F#m
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
                            D
Cause everything that you thought I would be
     A            E                 D
Has fallen apart right in front of you
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       F#m
Every step that I take is
  A                 D
another mistake to you
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
           F#m                        A
And every second I waste is more than I can take


[Chorus BUT ends in D]  F#m D A E (x2) D


[Bridge]
        E        F#m  G#m  A  C#m   D
And I know I may end  up  failing, too
        E            C#m
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Verse]
 I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone

[Interlude]
           I walk alone, I walk alone (Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah    Ahhh-Ah)
           I walk alone, I walk a.... (haaa-ah  Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ah-Ah)
[Verse]
 I walk this empty street, on the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps, and I'm the only one and I walk alone

[Chorus]
C#      G#           D#             Em#
    My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
    My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
    Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
C#        G#     C5
    Till then I walk alone

[Interlude]

[Verse]
 I'm walking down the line That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge And where I walk alone

[Interlude]

[Verse]
 Read between the lines What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive And I walk alone

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
I walk this empty street, on the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps, and I'm the only one and I walk a...

Just The Way You Are (Bruno Mars)
[Intro] ( Capo III )
D         Bm7
Ah, ah ah ah
      G            D
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
  D
Oh her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Bm7
 Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
G                                                                  D
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
            D
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
Bm7
 And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
G                                                                             D
 But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

[Chorus]
                               D                             Bm7
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
                        G                                             D
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
                           D                                        Bm7
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                              G                                             D
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are, (yeah)

[Verse 2]
D
 Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Bm7
 Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
G                                                                  D
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
        D
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
   Bm7
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
G                                                                                                      D
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

[Chorus]
            D                Bm7
The way you are, the way you are
             G                        D
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

Our time is short
            C
This is our fate,
         G
I'm yours

[Bridge]
G                     D             Em
Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
                       D               C
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                       A7
And I will nibble your ear

| G  Bm  | Em  D  | C     | A7    |

[Verse 3]
                   G
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    D
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
         C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  G
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   D
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
   Em
It's what we aim to do
    C
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus/Outro]
    G           D Dsus4
But I won't hesitate
            Em
No more, no more
          C            G
It cannot wait; I'm yours
                                     D
Well, open up your mind and see like me
             D                      Em
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                         C
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
   G
So please don't, please don't, please don't
           D        Dsus4
There's no need to complicate
           Em
'Cause our time is short
                              C
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
        A7
I'm yours

Hey There Delilah (Plain White T's)
[Intro] D  F#m D  F#m :: D (xx023x) F#m (xx422x) Bm (x2x43x) G (3xxx03x) A (x0x22(0))

[Verse 1]
D                            F#m
Hey there Delilah, What’s it like in New York City? 
      D                               F#m
I’m a thousand miles away, But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
        Bm  G                 A                  Bm
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
             A
I swear it’s true. 
Hey there Delilah, Don’t you worry about the distance, 
I’m right there if you get lonely, Give this song another listen, 
Close your eyes, Listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
I’m by your side. 

[Chorus]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm     
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,  (x2)
               D
What you do to me. 

[Verse 2]
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard, 
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
We'll have it good, We'll have the life we knew we would, 
My word is good. 
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say, 
If every simple song I wrote to you, Would take your breath away,
I’d write it all, Even more in love with me you’d fall, 
We’d have it all. 

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
G                                      A
A thousand miles seems pretty far, But they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
D                                 Bm
I’d walk to you if I had no other way 
G                                         A
Our friends would all make fun of us, And we'll just laugh along because, 
   D                                     Bm
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
G                               A
Delilah I can promise you, That by the time that we get through, 
    Bm                                               A
The world will never ever be the same, And you’re to blame. 

[Verse 3]
Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me, 
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, And I'll be making history, 
Like I do, You’ll know it's all because of you, 
We can do whatever we want to, 
Hey there Delilah here's to you, This one’s for you. 

[Chorus]
   Bm   D    Bm    D    Bm   D    Bm   D D

[Verse]
                           A
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
                D                         A
I know not everybody has got a body like you
                        A
But I've got to think twice before I give my heart away
            D                                          A
And I know all the games you play because I play them too
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
          D                       A
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
D                                  A
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
              D                  A       F#m7
Oh when that love comes down without devotion
          Bm                              E
Well it takes a strong man baby but I'm showing you the door
 
 
[Chorus]
                     A
‘Cause I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith
 
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
 
I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah
 
 
[Verse]
A
BABY, I know you're asking me to stay
                     D
Say please, please, please don't go away
                            A
You say I'm giving you the blues
A
MAYBE, you mean every word you say
                D
Can't help but think of yesterday
                 A
And another who tied, me, down, to, lover boy rules
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
  D                A
Before this river becomes an ocean
  D                                     A
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
            D            A      F#m7
Oh-baby-I reconsider my foolish notion
        Bm                               E
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more
 
 
[Chorus]
                 A
Yes I gotta have faith, I gotta have faith
 
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
 
I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah
 
 
[Solo]
A           D           A
                         I just have to wait, because I got to have
A           D           A
faith,      faith,      I got to, got to, got to have faith
 
 
[Pre-chorus]

Before this river becomes an ocean
  D                                     A
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I - just - got - to have faith)

G
Here's a little song I wrote
Am
You might want to sing it note for note
         C        G
Don't worry, be happy.

In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy.

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Am
Somebody came and took your bed

Don't worry, be happy.

The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy.
    G            G
Look at me -- I'm happy.

[Chorus]
G                   G                               G
Here I give you my phone number. When you worry, call me,
I make you happy.

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Am
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
         C        G
Don't worry, be happy.

'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
Don't worry, be happy.

Don't worry, be happy now.

Don't bring everybody down.

And all these thoughts are better left unsaid
Tell me the words that they only dream about
And everything that holds you

You'll never know that I just wanna feel this
I'll stop when I should go
I'll find my way to you

At her feet was her footloose man

To get your prescription filled

I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
F
I said to him

In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

  An island lost at sea

Englishman In New York (Sting)


[Verse 1]
Em               A          Bm
I don't drink coffee I take tea my dear
Em            A               Bm
I like my toast done on one side
Em          A               Bm
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
       Em            A     Bm
I'm an Englishman in New  York

See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
I'm an Englishman in New York

[Chorus]
Em      A    Bm
I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien
        Em        A        Bm
I'm an Englishman  in New York
Em      A    Bm
I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien
        Em        A      Bm
I'm an Englishman in New York


[Verse 2]
If, "Manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
D                       A
Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
Bm                             F#
You could end up as the only one
 G                        A
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
  F#/A#                               Bm
At night a candle's brighter than the sun


[Instrumental]
Em   A   Bm  x4


[Verse 3]
Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

If, "Manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say


[Chorus]

Hold me close and hold me fast
                    C6                      Dm7 G7
The magic spell you cast, this is la vie en ro-se
Dm7                      G7
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
                      Dm                    Dm7 G7
And though I close my eyes, I see la vie en ro-se

When you press me to your heart

I'm in a world apart, a world where roses bloom

And when you speak, angels sing from above
 Ebdim                         Dm
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs

[Intro]
G        Am Cm  G D


[Chorus]

G                      Gmaj7
Hold me close and hold me fast
                 Em
This magic spell cast
                  Am   D
This is la vie en ro - se

Am                     D
When you kiss me heaven sighs
                    Am
And though I close my eyes
   D            G   D
I see la vie en ro-se

G                         Gmaj7
When you press me to your heart
               Em
I'm in a world apart
     G             C
A world where roses bloom

Cm
 And when you speak
         G
Angels sing from above
A                                 D
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs

G                        Gmaj7
Give your heart and soul to me
                     Am D   C  D   G
And life will always be la vie en rose


[Verse]
            G
I thought love was just a word
       E    Am
They sung a-bout in songs I heard
    D        G                Dm
It took your kisses to reveal
            E                  D
That I was wrong, and love is real


[Chorus]
G                          Gmaj7
Quand il me prend dans ses bras
                 Em
Il me parle tout bas
                  Am   D
Je vois la vie en ro - se

Am                     D
 Il me dit des mots d'amour
                    Am
Des mots de tous le jours
   D                  G  G#m       D
Et ça me fait quelque chose

G                      Gmaj7
Il est entré dans mon coeur
               Em
Une part de bonheur
     G             C
Dont je connais la cause

Cm
C'est lui pour moi
         G
Moi pour lui dans la vie
A                                  D
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

G
 Et dès que je l'aperçois
                 Am   D   Am    D    G
Alors je sens en moi, mon coeur qui bat ...


G Gmaj7 Em  Am D Am D G

Ain’t No Sunshine (Bill Withers)
[Verse 1]
Am                           Am     Em G Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Am                        Am        Em G Am
It's not warm when she's away.
                             Em                              Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long,
                  Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.

Am                           Am     Em G Am
Wonder this time where she's gone,
Am                      Am       Em G Am
Wonder if she's gone to stay
                             Em                                 Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home,
                  Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.

[Interlude]

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
N.C.
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone

[Verse 2]
                                  Am      Em G Am
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                                  Am      Em G Am
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Am                  Am      Em G Am
only darkness everyday.
                             Em                                 Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
I'm just a Cyborg and I don't believe in God (The Cyborgs)
What is a pray
What do you say
Why in a church where you hope to be saved
You think is a god
Your misunderstood
That is just a man and his peace of wood
Oh no
This is not my home
Cause i'm not a human and I don't believe in God
Boogy 
Tell me no lies
Look in my eyes
Into the mirror we'll be no surprised
I'm not white
I'm not black
At the same time I can be happy and sad
Oh no
I wanna come back home
Cause i'm just a cyborg and I don't believe in God
Pray now
Uh uh
Boogie one
If you wanna see
How to be free
Come back in the future that you've never been
What is a pray
What do you say
Why in a church you hope to be saved
C'mon
Am I lost at home?
I'm just a cyborg and I don't believe in God
Boogie Time
Gotta pray now
It’s so sad
That’s good
Ain't no trouble
In a church, but why?
Yes
Well I'm just cyborg and I don't believe in God

So What

 [Verse 1]
Am
Keep you in the dark
               F#m7-5   Fmaj
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began
Am
Send in your skeletons
                                 D/F#    F
Sing as their bones go marching in... again
Am
The need you buried deep
                               D/F#
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
F              G
Are you ready?
Am
I'm finished making sense 
Done pleading ignorance
        D/F#         F   G
That whole ,  defense
Am
Spinning infinity, boy 
The wheel is spinning me
       D/F#         F         G
It's never-ending, never-ending
 D
 Same old story
 
 






[Chorus]
Am
What if I say I'm not like the others?
                                     D/F#
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
 
You're the pretender
F
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
 
Am
What if I say I'm not like the others?
                                   D/F#
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
 
You're the pretender
F
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am
In time or so i'm told
                           D/F#           F  G
I'm just another soul for sale... oh, well
Am
The page is out of print
 
We are not permanent
      D/F#          F          G
We're tem-po-rary, tem-po-rary
D
Same old story
 
 
[Chorus]
Am
What if I say I'm not like the others?
                                     D/F#

You're the pretender

 [Verse] [ Em D Bm C ]
Can't stop addicted to the shindig 
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big 
Choose not a life of imitation 
Distant cousin to the reservation 
Defunct the pistol that you pay for 
This punk the feeling that you stay for 
In time I want to be your best friend 
Eastside love is living on the westend 
Knocked out but boy you better come to 
Don't die you know the truth as some do 
Go write your message on the pavement 
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant 
White heat is screaming in the jungle 
Complete the motion if you stumble 
Go ask the dust for any answers 
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers 
 
[Chorus]
     G
The world I love 
     D
The tears I've dropped 
   Bm
To be part of

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone 
So smart she's leading me to ozone 
Music the great communicator 
Use two sticks to make it in the nature 
I'll get you into penetration 
The gender of a generation 
The birth of every other nation 
Worth your weight the gold of meditation 
This chapter's going to be a close one 
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one 
All on a spaceship persevering 
Use my hands for everything but steering 
Can't stop the spirits when they need you 
Mop tops are happy when they feed you 
Jay butterfly is in the treetop 
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

Wait a minute I'm passing out, win or lose, just like you 
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, how 'bout you 
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you 
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, right on cue 
 
[Verse]
Can't stop addicted to the shindig 
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big 
Choose not a life of imitation 
Distant cousin to the reservation 
Defunct the pistol that you pay for 
This punk the feeling that you stay for 
In time I want to be your best friend 
Eastside love is living on the westend 
Knocked out but boy you better come to 
Don't die you know the truth as some do 
Go write your message on the pavement 
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant 
Kick start the golden generator 
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her 
Can't stop the Gods from engineering 
Feel no need for any interfering 
Your image in the dictionary 
This life is more than ordinary 
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these 
Comin' from space to teach you of the Pliedes 
N.C.
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
N.C.
This life is more than just a read-thru

[Intro] | Am G | Dm Am | Am G | Dm Am |
[Verse 1]
Am                   G
 Getting born in the state of Mississippi,
    Dm                         Am
Her Poppa was a copper and her Momma was a hippie
Am          G
 In Alabama she would swing a hammer,
Dm                           Am
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
Am         G                   Dm       Am
 She never knew that there was anything more than poor,
Am           G               Dm      Am
 What in the world does your company take me for?

[Verse 2]
Am             G
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana,
Dm                       Am
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana,
Am               G
 She's a runner, rebel and a stunner,
Dm                        Am
On her merry way sayin', "baby whatcha gonna"
Am                 G           Dm         Am
  Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45,
Am             G          Dm
  Just another way to survive

Am              G
 She's a lover, baby and a fighter,
Dm                             Am
Shoulda seen it coming when it got a little brighter,
Am                 G
 With a name like "Dani California",
Dm                      Am
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya,
Am        G               Dm        Am
 A little loaded, she was stealing another breath
Am         G         Dm

 Who knew the other side of you?
Bm             G      D             F#
 Who knew what others died to prove?
Bm           G       D         F#
 Too true to say goodbye to you
Bm
 Too true, too sad, sad, sad

[Verse 4]
Am               G
 Push the fader, gifted animator,
Dm                   Am
One for the now and eleven for the later,
Am             G
 Never made it up to Minnesota,
Dm                     Am
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Am           G                Dm         Am
 Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last,
Am       G            | Dm       | E7
 It only hurts when I laugh;  gone too fast

Were in my life just to get high on  
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time

When I lay it on, come get to play it on  
All my life to sacrifice

When will I know that I really can't go  
To the well one more time to decide on  
When it's killing me, When will I really see  
All that I need to look inside  
Come to believe that I better not leave  
Before I get my chance to ride  
When it's killing me, When will I really see  
All that I need to look inside

Where it's so white as snow  
Privately divided by  a world  so undecided

Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed 
And there is nowhere to go

When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up

When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

[Verse 1]
Bsus2  Bm
Hello?
                 A
Is there anybody in there?
                    G      G/F#   Em
Just nod if you can hear me
         Bm
Is there anyone at home?
Bsus2      Bm
Come on now
              A
I hear you're feeling down
G          G/F#    Em
I can ease your pain
            Bm
And get you on your feet again
Bsus2  Bm
Relax
                    A
I'll need some information first
G             G/F# Em
Just the basic facts
        Bm
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Chorus]
D                          A
There is no pain you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
G/B C                             G
   You are only coming through in waves
G/B C                                       G
   Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                     A
When I was a child I had a fever
   D                           A
My hands felt just like two balloons
G/B C                             G
  Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain,
          G/B C                             G
You would not understand, This is not how I am

A   G/B  Cadd9         G                D
I               have become comfortably numb.

A  D  A  C  G  C  G
A   G/B C        G                D

[Verse 2]
Bsus2  Bm
O.K.
              A
Just a little pinprick
                    G    Em
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
            Bm
But you may feel a little sick
Bsus2         Bm
Can you stand up?
                  A
I do believe it's working, good
                 G                  Em
That'll keep you going through the show
     Bm
Come on it's time to go.

[Chorus]
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
G/B C                              G
    You are only coming through in waves
G/B  C                                      G
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                         A
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
D                       A
Out of the corner of my eye
G/B C                           G
    I turned to look but it was gone
                   G/B C
I cannot put my finger on it now
                        G
The child is grown, The dream is gone

Asus4   A  G/B  Cadd9    G                D
And  I           have become comfortably numb.

So, so you think you can tell,
             Am/E                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.

We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
D/F#                               C
 Running over the same old ground. What have we found?

The same old fears. Wish you were here!

Sera Was Never (DragonAge Inquisition)


[Verse]
Am                  G
Sera was never an agreeable girl -
    Am
Her tongue tells tales of rebellion.
Am
But she was so fast,
    Em             G
And quick with her bow,
Am
No one quite knew where she came from.
 
Am             G
Sera was never quite the quietest girl -
    Am
Her attacks are loud and they're joyful.
                         Em     G
But she knew the ways of nobler men,
    Am
And she knew how to enrage them.

[Verse]
Am                       G
Sera was never quite the wealthiest girl -
     Am
Some say she lives in a tavern.
Am
But she was so sharp,
    Em         G
and quick with bow -
Am
Arrows strike like a dragon.
 
Am                       G
Sera was never quite the gentlest girl -
Am
Her eyes were sharp like a razor.
                         Em       G
But she knew the ways of commoner men,
    Am
And she knew just how to use them.


[Refrain]
C                Em      G
She would always like to say,
Am
"Why change the past,
Am
when you can own this day?"
  C
Today she will fight,
   G
To keep her way.
        Am
She's a rogue and a thief,
Am
And she'll tempt your fate.

       On bended knee is no             way to be free
    G7                               C/E
       Lifting up an empty cup,       I ask silently

    D              Dsus2             D                 (Dsus4 D5)
        So I can breathe... 

     Circles they grow and they      swallow people whole
Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they’ll never know
   A mind full of questions,        and a teacher in my soul
     And so it goes...

        Don’t come closer or            I’ll have to go
     Holding me like gravity            are places that pull
     If ever there was someone        to keep me at home
     It would be you...

    Everyone I come across,          in cages they bought
They think of me and my wandering, but I’m never what they thought
   I’ve got my indignation,        but I’m pure in all my thoughts
   I’m alive...

        Wind in my hair,            I feel part of everywhere
  Underneath my being is a          road that disappeared 
Late at night I hear the trees, they’re singing with the dead
     Overhead...

    Leave it to me as I              find a way to be
    Consider me a satellite,          forever orbiting
    I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me
   Guaranteed...

Something warm going through my eyes, but somehow I found my baby that night

I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss, I'd found the love that I knew I had missed
      G                    Em                         C               D         G     G

     Know a man...       His face pulled and tense...           
          F  C        F    C              F    C     Am
Like he's riding on a motorbike... in the strongest winds

So I approach with tact... suggest that he should relax

But he's always moving much too fast  
                         Am  Asus2  Am
Said he'll see me on the flipside...
