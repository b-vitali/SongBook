[Verse 1]
            G    C     G                   F              G
It's been a hard day's night and I've been working like a dog
            G    C     G                  F               G
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping Like a log
           C                          D                               G    C   G
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do will make me feel all right

[Verse 2]
           G    C   G              F                G

     G                C        G                 F            G
it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything
          C                                D                           G    C G
So why on earth should I moan cause when I get you alone you know I'll feel O.K.

         Bm   Em                     Bm
When I'm home everything seems to be right
         G    Em                     C6     D
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah!
