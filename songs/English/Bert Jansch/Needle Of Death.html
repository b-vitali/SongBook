    Capo on 3rd
    [Verse]
    A            A6         D/A
    When sadness fills your heart
        F#m                            Eadd9        E9
    And sorrow hides the longing to be free
    A              A6         D/A
    When things go wrong each day
    F#m                              Eadd9        E9
    You fix your mind to 'scape your misery

    [Chorus]
    F#m
    Your troubled young life
        A        A6
    Had made you turn
         D/A            Eadd9        E9
    To a needle of death

    How strange, your happy words
    Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
    How tears have filled the eyes
    Of friends that you once had walked among

    [Chorus]

    One grain of pure white snow
    Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
    In peace your mind withdraws
    Your death's so near your soul can't feel no pain

    [Chorus]

    Your mother stands a'cryin'
    While to the earth your body's slowly cast
    Your father stands in silence
    Caressing every young dream of the past

    [Chorus]

    Through ages, man's desires
    To free his mind, to release his very soul
    Has proved to all who live
    That death itself is freedom for evermore

    [Chorus]

    End on A
